<h2> gojo's six eyes explained!</h2>
<h4>fun fact</h4>
	
<p> It's interesting to note that while any member of the Gojo family can inherit the Limitless, only those who possess the Six Eyes can master the technique. This ability allows Jujutsu Kaisen's Gojo to process visual information in an accelerated manner while aiding him in manipulating the nuanced energies of the Limitless. Since every technique requires complex cursed energy manipulation to function, the pairing with the Six Eyes remains crucial, especially when engaged in a fight against special grade cursed spirits. Gojo also seems to have mastered the Six Eyes to the extent that he never runs out of cursed energy, as the amount of energy lost during the technique is close to zero. As Gojo keeps his eyes hidden throughout the initial episodes of the anime, the reveal of the Six Eyes against Jogo is especially noteworthy. When used to perform a reverse cursed technique, the processing abilities of the Six Eyes can be deemed limited and holds the risk of taking a toll on the userâ€™s psyche, driving them to the edge of sanity if overused. However, when used in conjunction with the Limitless, they can read incoming projectile threats and reversed cursed techniques automatically. Although Gojo is still able to exercise enhanced perception with his eyes bandaged, he needs to uncover them in order to unleash Limitless techniques such as Hollow Purple. </p>
