	<h1> start by the things around me! </h1>
	<p>My name is Gojo Satoru. I was born on December 7, 1989. I was born as a member of the Gojo family and the first child to possess Rikugan (six eyes) after centuries.I'am studying at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School. My hobby is to tease megumi, my student. As for now my role model would be Jennie from blackpink, she is so naturally have a 'vibe' around her and she is so unbothered sometimes it amuse me. My motivation to live would be money. I want to live till i got loaded money i earned. I got a nickname "the cursed child" by someone name gege akutami. My one and only friend name Getou. He's a big build guy with the funniest sense of humor. He was like my soulmate, my platonic soulmate.</p>

<p>I used to be really lonely but since i joined high school i met a few friends that ease up the loneliness. I was really glad.
I enjoy dessert so much. People around me call me sweet tooth. I always bought a dessert especially the sweet one everytime i went on a trip. 

I also had disaffection against the current Jujutsu society. I became a teacher of Tokyo Jujutsu high school to solve the problem in a different way from Geto.

I tried to raise young Jujutsu sorcerers and change the Jujutsu world fundamentally. As a part of that, I went to see Megumi and invited him to the Tokyo high.</p>
